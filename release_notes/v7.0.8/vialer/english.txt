- When registering the App there is a step to ignore battery optimizations.
- The status of ignoring battery optimizations is visible in the settings menu and should be enabled when audio issues occur.
- Better feedback will be given if an outgoing call fails.
- The incoming call notification will always show the number (in addition if the contact exists).
