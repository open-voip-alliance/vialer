releaseNotes: "- The app has been completely redesigned from a user experience and technical perspective.\n- All calls are encrypted by default. The encryption setting has been removed.\n- The audio quality setting has been removed. All calls use an optimised quality setting.\n- Two-step calling has been replaced with call-through. This offers a more clear and simple user-experience but using it will incur charges from the mobile provider rather than being billed directly to the client."
